title: If I could only remember what I wanted
---
 
I just finished up this track that I have been working on for a really long time, which is a departure frommy standard method of working. Normally I finish a song in less than a day with either a nap or a nights sleep in the middle. I also changed up my working methods just a little bit, completing this track entirely in reason, instead of using my demo copy of <a href="http://www.ableton.com/">live</a> to arrange.

It is a bit of totally synthesized dark techno / downtempo stuff called <a id="p7" onmousedown="selectLink(7);" href="http://jonbro.tk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/if%20I%20could%20only%20remember%20what%20I%20wanted.mp3">If I could only remember what I wanted</a>. I hope you all enjoy it, I like it quite a bit and it is probably the closest to approaching the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//www.monolake.de/&ei=SDr-Q7TYKaLMqQK0nKDwCQ&sig2=8stb_xYDIZP-ZZcXx0ZP5A">monolake</a> sound that I have been trying to achieve in my recent stuff. I came up with the title on a whim, but I think that it describes my a.d.d. pretty well.
