title: Week one of "the creative act"
---
 
I just finished my projects for week one of the creative act. Only three days late, woo! My theme was "decay", and that started as meaning iterative decay, but by the end of the week it ended up being about signal loss and addition through poor documentation. A stronger theme through the week was that everything was an animation, and most of it had to do with creative screen capturing.

Without further ado, here are the videos. Presented as a youtube playlist, as I am trying to roll with the prol'

//edit:

apparently I need to just link for you, as embedding isn't working.
