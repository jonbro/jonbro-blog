hey floks, we all know you sleep. You don't have to show it to us to drive the point home. 
<br />
<br />I got really angry watching <a href="http://chapambrose.com/interactiondesign/mediacontrol/scenariosmall.mov">this</a> because it reminded me that almost every product demonstration video that I have seen a design student make includes a section with them sleeping. some times the whole video is about them sleeping. unless the sleeping actually proves something, don't include it. I think that one of my major complaints is the fact that no one ever performs that well directly out of bed. 
<br />
<br />I wish I had more examples to show, but sadly I have not collected design demonstration videos. 
<br />
<br />On another note, the wakeup scene was used well in "ghost in the shell" but that was only because you were like, what the hell is a robot doing sleeping?!?!
