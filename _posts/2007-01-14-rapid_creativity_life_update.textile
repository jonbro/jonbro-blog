title: Rapid creativity, Life Update
---
 
<p>I recently participated in a time limited art project, <a href="http://54hours.org/">54hours.org</a>, where you get a sentence on friday evening, and have until sunday night to complete a short movie based on the sentence. This was by far the most relaxed time-limited art project that I have participated in, far less brain destroying than the 24 hour comic, and far less time management focused than the month long album. Also, the fact that it was a team effort added quite a bit to the fun. <a href="http://mirror.video.blip.tv/54hourmovieproject-BrownianMotionOrAreWeDancin463.m4v">Feel free to download our submission behind this link</a>.</p>


	<p>This weekend was yet another partymode/college friends reunion. I helped <a href="http://eli.pousson.net/blog">Eli Pousson (former roommate) set up his blog</a>, which will probably be anthropology/transportation related. Also, I will be going to <span class="caps">NYC</span> on the second of February, and will also hopefully have time to hang out with everyone there.</p>


	<p>And yet one final update, if you don&#8217;t have enough diary type entries from me, I tend to update <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonbro">my twitter feed</a> with shorter, less interesting and context free stuff.</p>
