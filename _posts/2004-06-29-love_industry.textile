<font size = "3">My old time <em>tovarish</em><font size ="1">  (comrade)   </font> Jonathan Brodsky says it best: aint nothin in life bettar than communication 29893 !!expression.  Why do we communicate?  So we avoid bombing cultures we dont understand for corporate profiteering. So much beauty is to be found in every crevice of cultural friction.  We want understanding between cultures and communities of a seemingly polarized nature.   For me, the political aspect of communicative power is most prevalent in the politics of food industry.  Not enough love!  We need more love in the food industry!  As it says in the ancient texts: <em>Sell to ye subjects not ye lowest quality crop to rip they moneys off, but Sell to ye subjects the highest quality crop so that ye subjects may proliferate and understand ye moral philosophies!</em>

<br />The words of this tongue will become twofold as we explore the Industry.  More Industry to follow! </font>
