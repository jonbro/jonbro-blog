Saw <a href="http://k9d.livejournal.com/61564.html">this over at k9d's livejournal</a>, and thought it was a nice idea, so here goes.

The first five people that leave a comment in this post are going to get a one of a kind piece of art, created by me, shipped to them. The only catch is that they also have to post the same offer in their webloggy thingy, or make an announcement in a public forum or whatever.

Ok, go!

[<em>edit</em>] just went back and re-read the original post, and it looks like you don't actually need to continue the meme, but it would be nice. I will be getting in contact with responders for snail-mail addresses soon.
