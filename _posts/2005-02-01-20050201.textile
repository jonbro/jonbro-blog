Although the ornate decoration reflects the convention for human architecture of the time it seems that it was meant as a gesture of respect for the importance of birds within Turkish culture.<br /><br />I liked this poem from the site:<br /><br />Mehmet Zaman Sacliolus poem, Bird Houses;<br />The outer walls of houses should be bird houses<br />That take wing when children laugh.<br />Even if its winter outside,<br />The summer sun should rise inside the walls<br />And happiness will also warm the birds.
