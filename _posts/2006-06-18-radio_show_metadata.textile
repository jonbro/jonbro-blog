Just a quick post today to see how I can cross promote both my radioshow (sundays at noon until 2pm on <a href="http://www.wrct.org">wrct</a>) and my blog (you are already here). Here are some links to the things that I played on my show that are free to consume...

<a href="http://blibbblobb.blogspot.com/2006/02/blibb-blobb-episode-005.html">the blibbblobb podcast</a> - amazingly fantastic chiptune remixes with no annoying talking on top

<a href="http://www.zymogen.net/releases/zym006/">bacanal intruder - modem</a> - awesome free net.label release, along the lines of nobukazu takemura, but cuter somehow, and with far less vocoders.

<a href="http://www.cockrockdisco.com/free.html">Audiogarde - Mardi Gras</a> - from the cock rock disco free compilation, most everything else on this comp is breakcore, but this is one tasty little disco nugget.

<a href="http://www.mono211.com/content/releases/mtkmp166.html">Tim Koch - Elk Meadow EP</a> -  beautiful melodies and simple drum lines from one of the oldest net.labels

<a href="http://one.dot9.ca/2/releases.php?id=021"><font color="#000000">emil klotzsch - sandkorn</font></a> - collage sounds, nice melodies, interesting instrumentation
