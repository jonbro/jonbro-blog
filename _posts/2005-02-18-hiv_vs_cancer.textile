title: HIV vs. Cancer
---

I have been telling people about this all day. I think it is about the coolest thing that I have ever heard. <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=5921">So dope</a>. Essentially, HIV turns out to be a pretty good virus to use as a carrier for gene therapy. So some researchers are using it to fight cancer.<br /><br />Also, I made a little <a href="http://s5.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=0KIXSCTRPTWWV2HR6QUUNBVC7U">music video</a>. It is part two in a series.<br /><br />Also, I would like to know if this posting method is working out for my readers. Should I do more of a one idea, one title thing? Or is this <span style="font-style: italic;">ALSO </span>method working out?<br /><br />respond in the comments section
