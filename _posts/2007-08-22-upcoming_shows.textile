Holy Crap dudes, two upcoming shows! Apparently if I set my mind to it, something will totally happen.

On <strong>Friday, August 24th, at Garfield Artworks, 8pm</strong> (probably 5-7 dollars, all ages)
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/atouchofwonder">Huxtables</a> (totally sweet trashy instrumental surf rock)
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/snakessayhisss">SnakesSayHisss</a> (synthpop sweetness)
JonBro (its me! more on that at the end of the post)
Jacob Pope & The Free Agents

<strong>Some video from The Huxtables</strong>

and then!!!

At <strong>Kopec's (3523 Penn Ave) on Saturday, September 1st at 10pm</strong> (5$ and 21+)
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/captainahab">Captain Ahab</a> (fucking mental early 90's homoerotic synthpop)
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/realicide">Realicide</a> (Experimental Happy Hardcore?)
<a href="  http://www.myspace.com/lordbirdgoldencobra  ">LORD BIRD GOLDEN DISKO SHOWER</a>
and JonBro (ME!!!@?#!@?)

I am super excited to play with captain ahab. I remember discovering their music right after mp3.com went belly up. Holy crap. It is like a little slice of my past.

<strong>What I am up to?</strong>
I have been doing backing tracks on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP2X">GP2x</a> with live drumming and singing, and I am fucking proud of it. If anyone wants to book me in their city, let me know. I am pumped for some touring right about now.
