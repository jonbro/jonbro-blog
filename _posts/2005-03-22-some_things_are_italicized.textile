Elijahsays:<i> now lets change the topic to the usefulness of italics</i><br />Allansays:<i> Italics are useful to emphasize single words or to give whole sentences newfound authority.</i><br /><br />Also here is a segment on Lactic Acid from our beloved wikipedia:<br /><br />This lactic acid fermentation occurs in <a title="Red blood cell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell">red blood cells</a> since they don't have <a title="Mitochondria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, and in skeletal <a title="Muscle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle">muscle</a> during intense exertion when sufficient amounts of <a title="Oxygen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen">oxygen</a> cannot be supplied fast enough. This lactate is released into the bloodstream. The typical lactate concentration in the blood is 1-2 <a title="Micro" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro">m</a><a title="Mol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mol">mole</a>/<a title="Litre" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre">L</a>. The <a title="Liver" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver">liver</a> takes up about 60% of the lactate and reoxidizes it to pyruvate, which is then reconverted to <a title="Glucose" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose">glucose</a> in a process known as <a title="Gluconeogenesis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a>. The glucose enters the bloodstream and can be used by the tissues. This glucose → lactate → glucose cycle, originally described by <a title="Carl Cori" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Cori">Carl</a> and <a title="Gerty Cori" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerty_Cori">Gerty Cori</a>, is known as the Cori cycle. About 40% of the lactate is taken up by well oxygenated muscle cells and oxidized to pyruvate, which is then directly used to fuel the <a title="Citric acid cycle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle">citric acid cycle</a>.
