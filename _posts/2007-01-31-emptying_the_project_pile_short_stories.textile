title: Emptying the project pile (short stories)

A while back I attempted to finish a short story. My methodology was to bring a few people along with me, hoping that by all of us sharing the same goal I would be able to finish mine easier. That turned out not to be the case, as I struggled through it as much as I have with any piece of writing. I guess I wrote something, which in itself was an achievement.

Yann managed to finish a quite nice story, <a id="p41" href="http://jonbro.tk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Darkness.pdf">Darkness</a> (pdf). Kudos to you sir, you have put my writing chops to shame. Perhaps we will meet on this field of words again, and that time, I will be prepared for you.
Also, for those that are suckers for punishment, I submit for you, <a id="p40" href="http://jonbro.tk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/captain_angrypants.txt">Captain AngryPants</a> (txt).

Tomorrow I start creating a piece of art a day, to be documented at: <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/~hf35/creativeact/">The Creative Act</a>. Wish me luck!
