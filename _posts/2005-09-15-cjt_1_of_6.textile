today I went through the motions of the first drunken conversation that I generally have with a person. family mental health history, drug usage, big plans. I suppose that it always ends up at the big plans stage.

<br />(1) Today I went out for a coupla' drinks with my boss, and we ended up talking about the basics...
<br />(2) or at least I did, covered the mental health of my family, my drug use family, and my large plans.
<br />(3) [me sitting with my 3rd glass of beer (dark)]
<br />(4) she offered me to trade a painting for theknowledgeoftheweb.
<br />(5) I told her about my emo ass comics...
<br />(6) ...
