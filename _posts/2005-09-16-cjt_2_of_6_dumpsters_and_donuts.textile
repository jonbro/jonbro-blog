title: c.j.t (2 of 6) - dumpsters and donuts
---

last night I went with my roommate billy to get rid of a trashcan that the garbage men had not been emptying. The cops rolled up just as we were tipping it into the dumpster outside of his office and informed us that we were "stealing services". Later on, while coming home from the bar, I decided I wanted some donuts. the store that I went to had those same cops in it! I said, "do you have any donuts?", and the attendent said "you will have to wait until 4 or 5 am"
