title: Car related movies to watch
---
 
<p>I saw <em>Grindhouse</em> yesterday, and it was pretty awesome for a tex-sploitation zombie flick / muscle car slasher chase movie. Clearly, there were some major downsides, but stuff &#8220;blew&#8217;d up real good&#8221; and the presentation with previews separating the movies was unabashedly great.</p>


	<p>After watching it, I tracked down <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_Point">Vanishing Point</a></em>, a movie which was referenced many times during the Tarintino section, <em>Death Proof</em>. <em>Vanishing Point</em> was fantastic as well, and really makes me want to go on a muscle car genre binge. Here is a list culled from some wikipedia&#8217;ing (is there a better verb form of that?).</p>

		<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_%28film%29">Cannonball</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>I will report back when I have completed this list. Wish me luck, and also if you would like to join me for any screenings, let me know.</p>
