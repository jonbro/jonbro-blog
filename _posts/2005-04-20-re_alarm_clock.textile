title: REGARDING alarm clock.
---

my dad sent me this response to my alarm clock idea... I think that it is a good one.<br /><blockquote><br />Actually the solution to the alarm clock problem is to have it shut off only by a key that is in the class room where the first class to be attended is. The Alarm Clock should be attached to the student permanently (Handcuffs or the equivalent). That will insure that the student gets to class on time. Alarm ringing all the way to class. Well Actually chaining the shut off key outside the dormitory door or somewhere down the street may be equally as effective. But I can imagine that some students might show up at class in pajamas, turn off the alarm clock,and then return home to sleep.</blockquote>BRILLIANT!
