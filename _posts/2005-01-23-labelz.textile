I have been trying to resist posting this because it would almost make this feed seem as if it had a life, but I really can't resist.
<br />
<br />my first ever interweb label release is out on <a href="http://floppyswop.co.uk/">floppyswop</a>. I don't know if anyone is reading this blog, but if you are, please go download.
<br />
<br />on a only slightly related note, I think that maybe the point of these things are to write as if no one else is reading for the maximum potential energy of the folksonomy/emergent intelligence of the net to form. Or maybe not, but that is a nice thought isn't it?
