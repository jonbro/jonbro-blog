the transparent press makes a prediction for the democratic canidate for 2012.
<br />from the blog
<br />"<span style="font-style:italic;">Obama was appearing berfore an audience of a well-heeled West L.A. crowd, but his message of lifting up the kid from the south side of Chicago lifted even the most jaded Santa Monican. It was a great political moment and I have no doubt that he will be the first African American with a legitimate shot at the White House in 2012.</span>"
