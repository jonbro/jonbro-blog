A forum / release system that runs on the same type of principals that guide a MMORPG seems like it may be a nice way to develop content for a print journal mayhaps? I have never played a mmorpg, except for about 5 minutes of the beta version of ultima online, so perhaps something like this would only work for systems that expect a ton of people to participate.
