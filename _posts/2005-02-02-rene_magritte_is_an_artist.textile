<br />Corporate Lesson #2:
<br />A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the on the
<br />side of the road.  He stopped and offered her a lift,
<br />which she accepted.  She got in and crossed her legs,
<br />forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg.  The
<br />priest had a look and nearly had an accident.
<br />
<br />After regaining control of the car, he stealthily slid
<br />his hand up her leg.  The nun looked at him and
<br />immediately said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"  The
<br />priest was flustered and apologized profusely.  He
<br />forced himself to remove his hand.  Changing gear, he
<br />let his hand slide up her leg again.
<br />
<br />The nun once again said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"
<br /> Once again, the priest apologized.  "Sorry, Sister,
<br />but the flesh is weak."  Arriving at the convent, the
<br />nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and went on
<br />her way.
<br />
<br />Upon his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to
<br />retrieve a bible and looked up Psalm 129.  It Said "Go
<br />forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."
<br />
<br />Moral of the story: If you are not well informed in
<br />your job, you might miss a great opportunity.</span>
