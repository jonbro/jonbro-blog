title: almost happy one year old

I was filling out this survey from mit about weblogs, and I noticed that this one is quickly approaching its 1st birthday!!! happy birthday!<br /><br />I don't yet know what I am going to do to celebrate. Maybe give it a new name and purpose in life? maybe post everyday for the next week?<br /><br />I wish that I could buy it a present, like a new host or something like that. I don't know if I can afford that though.<br /><br />perhaps I will make it something... like a redesign?<br /><br />and because weblogs need <a href="http://www.kidsparties.com/traditions.htm">links</a>.
