title: Cut My Voice On the Chorus
---

I just finished watching an <a href="http://kembrew.com/documentaries/">ok documentary</a> on sampling and although 96% of it was old hat, right at the end, 3 artist suggested that it would be an honor for them to hear themselves over the chorus. So, I am gonna do that. I guess they would probably like it if I bought their albums, but I don't know if I am willing to go quite that far.<br /><br />wow, the post frequency has really gone down here.<br /><br />well, it was fun while it lasted wasn't it?
