	<p>I just got back from blockparty 2007, and it was freaking great. For those not initiated on the concept of a demoparty, as explanation, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoparty'>ubiquitous wikipedia link</a>. I have never been to a demo party before, but as my consciousness said when I preregistered, &#8220;my 14 year old self will not forgive me for skipping this&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Truthfully, it has been a while since I have watched any demos, but being in a room full of demo fans screaming a visual when some sweet tunnel effect comes up on screen was totally fantastic. A bunch of the demos brought a tear to my eye. Also the passion of all the demoscene people was palpable. It was really nice to be in a room with people that are passionate about computer graphics for arts sake, and in a concepts be damned, lets push some pixels kind of way.</p>


	<p>I entered only three of the compos this year, and managed to only come in last place in one of them. I came in second in a &#8220;freestyle compo&#8221; which was freestyle rapping over that timbaland track ripped from a demoscene tune. For that I won an effects pedal from <a href="http://www.effector13.com/">Effector 13</a>, which is fucking awesome. I came in second to last in the freestyle music compo (any type of entry) and came in last in the chiptune compo. Ah well, next year better eq&#8217;ing and better music. I imagine the entries will be available on the web at some point, and I will throw up a link to them when I get it.</p>


	<p>Also while at the party I managed to finish off an entry for the lgpt 10k contest and <a href="http://10pm.org/nostromo/lgpt/sounds.php">it is up on the web right now</a>. I am really enjoying the dubsteppy chip stuff, and I think I am gonna try to do a whole ep worth of it eventually. And in related, &#8220;new releases&#8221; news, an ep that I did for meltrecords is also up on the web now. That one is more of a dark electro thing, and there are some great remixes on it from both 5dots, the melt records head, and the amazing rolo, who really made the track that I gave him great. So, go download <a href="http://meltrecords.net/">This shower is a suspended bucket</a>.</p>


	<p>Any who! next year, and there will be a next year, as it has been promised by the great jason scott, I will hopefully be entering many more of the compos, esp. the demo compo. <span class="caps">BECAUSE DANG IT TUNNELS ARE AWESOME</span>! Greetz and thanks to everyone there, you all made it super fun.</p>


	<p>As a bonus, two deloreans passed me on the drive back to Pittsburgh. Back to the future dudes, back to the future.</p>
