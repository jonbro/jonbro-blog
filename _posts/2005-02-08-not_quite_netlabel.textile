title: Not Quite Net.Label
---

While watching a Cory Doctorow speach tonight on the web, I came up with a nice idea. He mentioned that asimov's science fiction magazine payed very small amounts to a very small percentage of the writers that submitted (i.e. the few writers that got published).
<br />
<br />So, what net.labels are able to pay artists for music that they host? I think that I could pony up a dollar per a release if I ran a net label. I guess what I am trying to say is that giving away hosting is not enough of an incentive for me to send music to other people to allow them to distribute. The net.labels are getting something out of it as well, right?
<br />
<br />also, how do you feel about this new text size? I like it.
