I am trying to figure out where this weblog is going, as always. I would like to consolidate my feeds somehow, possibly on this page. Right now, they are all located at <a href="http://jonbro.suprglu.com/">this suprglu account</a> which is comprised of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jonbro/">my flickr feed</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/jonbro">my links</a>, and various other junk. I think I am going to move it all here as soon as I have a free moment (unless there is a uproar from the crowd). More details to follow as to why I don't have any time.

hint: it has to do with my new job.
