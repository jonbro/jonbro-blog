1. Don't post every day if you don't have something to say, it just cheapens the whole mess of words that are up here.
<br />2. If you don't have something good to say, make up some litigous statements, or something that you can spend more time commenting on.
<br />3. While adding to the metadata of the web is nice, it is also necessary if you are a poor writer.
<br />4. Only post links to songs if you can provide full length high quality mp3 or at least something by the same artist that sounds similar, or an artist with a similar sounding name.
<br />5. Having something better to do is no excuse for not posting.

<br />GOD I HATE WRITING!!! OMG! F.
<br />
<br />also, I have been commenting alot over on <a href="http://gutterbreakz.blogspot.com/">gutterbreakz</a>, so feel free to hit that up, and read what I have to say there.
