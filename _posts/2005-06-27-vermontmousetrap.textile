Sadly, we do not have any mousetraps, and when I was talking about my roommates about it (while watching the daily show) <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/DaveYoung">dave</a> suggested that we build the mousetrap illustrated here. <br /><br />He then suggested that we put a webcam on the thing so that we can record the workings of the vermont mousetrap.<br clear="all" />
