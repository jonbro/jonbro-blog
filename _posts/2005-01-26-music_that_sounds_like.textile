title: music that sounds like
---

When squarepusher was just learning to play the bass, and his friend came over with a harmonica, and then they built a robot drummer, but was made mostly out of a car that they had stolen earlier that week, so the snare drum never sounded quite right.
<br />
<br />the guy with the harmonica said, "hey, lets go to the liquor store and buy some 40s" but on his way through the front door he was shot, so squarepusher jammed the harmonica in his mouth while he was breathing his last breaths.
