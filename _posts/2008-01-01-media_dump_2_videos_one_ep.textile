Here are some videos that I just put together today. First to clear your pallet, some footage from the parking lot of a Prime Outlets mall in western PA. Audio is from a very short song I found floating around my hard drive.

Here is some footage of a show I played last night. Please excuse the dropouts, I had my laptop sitting ontop of my bass amp, and I guess that doesn't make for very good hard drive writing.

Finally, a short ep, which I have been giving away at shows, and I had for sale on the front page of my website, I have decided to give away. Please enjoy, and share this link where ever you would like.
