This sounds cool:

<br />keys in the car and the spare keys are home, and you
<br />don't have "OnStar," here's your answer to the
<br />problem:
<br />
<br />If someone has access to the spare remote at your
<br />home, </span><span style="font-style: italic;font-family:PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif;" >call them on your cell phone (or borrow one from</span><span style="font-style: italic;font-family:PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif;" >
<br />someone if the cell phone is locked in the car too!)
<br />Hold your (or anyone's) cell phone about a foot from
<br />your car door and have the other person at your home
<br />press the unlock button, holding it near the phone on
<br />their end. Your car will unlock. Saves someone from
<br />having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no
<br />object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if
<br />you can reach someone who has the other "remote" for
<br />your car, you can unlock the doors (or the trunk, or
<br />have the "horn" signal go off, or whatever!)
<br />
<br />(Editor's Note * It works fine! We tried it out and it
<br />unlocked our car over a cell phone!) Distance doesn't
<br />seem to be a factor.
