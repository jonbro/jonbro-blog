This is the scene outside the house called partymode as <a href="http://theamazingrolo.blogspot.com/">yann</a> was leaving. Sad to see him go, but I know that he is off to better things.
I started my new job the same week, at <a href="http://walltowall.com/">wall to wall</a> here in pittsburgh, and the past two weeks working there have been quite the experience. I would really like to continue to work there for a long time. The office environment is great and really encouraging (I got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jonbro/122766641/">employee of the week</a> already). I have some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jonbro/tags/jonbrowalltowall/">photos of the office</a> posted up on the flickr stream, for your 'virtual touring' pleasure.

Next time, homebrew update! (hint: it is doing great)
