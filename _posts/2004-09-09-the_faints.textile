Hello?
<br />
<br />the ignoring stops now, at least temporarily. I witnessed some astonishing events that occured this morning, but vow to keep radio silence on them. 
<br />
<br />ok, enough for now, see you later.
<br />
<br />[edit]
<br />
<br />I just spent two hours writing an on how to justify to placement of pain management clinics in locations that are outside the existing hospital structure, but my computer crashed and I lost all of it, so maybe another day you will get it. 
<br />
<br />damn and blast.
<br />
