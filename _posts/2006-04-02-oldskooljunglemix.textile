Hey there folks, I got a little jungle mix for you called <a href="http://jonbro.tk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/asterisk_mouth(oldskool_jungle%20mix).mp3">asterisk_mouth</a>. It is mostly oldskool jungle off of the <a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/365093">illegal pirate radio comps</a>, but I had a few slips and put in some new <a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/459865">trendy stuff</a>. I have not put together a tracklist, but if you would like one, just drop me a note in the comments.

Things have been pretty interesting around the partymode this week and weekend. Our house has gone from the normal payload of six, down to just three. Due to the fact that we lost our designated cook for the weekend, the remaining three had a dinner of whatever vaguely mexican stuff we could pick up at the grocery store. I am feeling pretty full right now.

Well, I am running out of things to say, but the file is still uploading. Urm, whatever, peace out!
