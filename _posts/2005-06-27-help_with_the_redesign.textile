title: Help with the redesign
---

I just started working on the redesign this afternoon, and I would like to just have a little fun contribution session.<br /><br />If any of our multitude of readers (that is you yann) could write some one liners describing what this blog is or why you read it, I will include it in the redesign. It is totally like a magazine contest, except instead of getting moderately excited about winning, you will get a similar feeling to when you toss a bum a quarter on a street corner.<br /><br />some ideas to get you started:<br /><br />why read if it isn't the deep thoughts of a hot cam girl?<br />for your consideration: a link that I found on someones personal diary<br />we are all friends here. OR SO THEY THOUGHT. a new movie from jerry bruckhimer.<br />if you think you can't write or have nothing to say... check THIS out<br />aweblogbysomepeoplethatyoumayknoworenjoythecompanyof<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">anyways</span>... just drop them in the comments section.<br />and hold onto your pants for the upcoming redesign. it is gonna be a<span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"> scorcher.</span>
